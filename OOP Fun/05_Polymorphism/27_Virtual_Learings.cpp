/*
    Virtual means existing in appearance but not in reality.

    virtual void function();

    We have made base class function virtual so that only derived class functionality getes called...

    Why?
        ------> When we want to ensure only the latest functionality get called.
        ------> Late bindig , compiler defer the decision.
